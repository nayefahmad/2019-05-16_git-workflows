Winnie's big adventure 

Once upon a time there was a bear named Winnie the Poo.
Poo was a big fan of honey.
He'd eat it every day for breakfast, lunch, dinner, and second dinner along with a helping of salad and fish.
Vitmanins are important bro!
But this morning he ran out of honey.
"Oh boy, oh no, oh dear. I'm all out of honey" Poo said.
"Whatever will I do?" he said with a deep sigh.
