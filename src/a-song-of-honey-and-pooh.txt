Winnie's big adventure 

Once upon a time there was a bear named Winnie the Poo.
Poo was a big fan of honey.
He'd eat it every day for breakfast, lunch, dinner, and second dinner along with a helping of salad and fish.
Vitmanins are important bro!
But this morning he ran out of honey.
"Oh boy, oh no, oh dear. I'm all out of honey" Poo exclaimed. 
"Whatever will I do?" he said with a deep sigh.

Unknown to Poo dark forces were working in the background.
Nayef had stolen Poo's honey hoping to starve him.
Without the honey he knew poo would become weak and frail making him an easy target.
Mwahahaha!!!!

On the other side of the grove Christopher Robin had just emerged from the magic tree.
"Oh what a great sunny day we have here" he said.
"I wonder where Poo is? He is usually sitting on his favorite log".
Christopher then set off to find his friend.
On the way he ran into a jabberwocky! 

He recalled his father's warning from many years ago, 
He distinctly remembered it was in the bleak December
And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor, 
And the silken, sad, uncertain rustling of each purple curtain
Thrilled him—filled him with fantastic terrors never felt before;

His father said: 
"Beware the Jabberwock, my son! 
The jaws that bite, the claws that catch! 
Beware the Jubjub bird, and shun 
The frumious Bandersnatch!”
